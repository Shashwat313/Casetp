# SHADES - The Skin Pigment analysis app for Electrothon

## Organizational-Problem-Statement:

[IEEE Mandi (Go Online)](https://www.notion.so/Organizational-Problem-Statements-ac0bd0cea6a44920ab845dc8f72379b1#ec0c8cacba5846faa9323feecdcd9959)

As we all know that the world is permanently moving in online mode by all possible ways and after the end of this pandemic people will prefer **'Go online'** in every walk of life but this new era comes with many problems which need to be solved.

In the upcoming scenario of **'the new normal'**, everything is about to get digitalized. We would like you to propose a solution for the medical industry to promote touchless diagnosis.

Build a framework to **analyze the skin pigmentation** of a patient and generate a **detailed medical report** for the same. Use machine learning to study the skin color of the patient.

The evaluation will be on the basis of how detailed your report is!

Your Data-set should be trained to predict the relevant biological functioning of the person.

One of the **example** to demonstrate this is: Usually, Typhoid can cause a rash, which consists of small pink spots which are sometimes referred to as “rose spots”. Each spot tends to last around 3-5 days. You can detect those and prepare a report for the same.
